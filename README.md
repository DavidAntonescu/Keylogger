# Simple-Keylogger
As the title suggests, this is nothing more but a simple keylogger made in Python.

To start, you will need to have python3 and pip installed.
Do pip install pynput

And afterwards you are pretty much done, just run the logger.pyw and type anything, to see that it works, check key_log.txt.
